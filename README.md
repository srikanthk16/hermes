anemoi
======

NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS

Anemoi is God of Directions.
This php written application is for transit systems like buses, trains, metro, trams. It provides users a database to find how to travel from one place to another in the city. It is easy to install and is efficient.
Currently the system doesnt include maps or full fledged system like Google transit, it is a mere alternative implementation in PHP. It finds ways to travel on basis of three optimality conditions
1. Route with least transfers
2. Route with least time 
3. Route with least distance

It proudly uses 
1. JQuery and JqueryUI
2. Foundation Framework
3. PHP5 and MYSQLi
4. Developed using XAMPP stack, Notepad++, git-scm
